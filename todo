Lua uses a hand-written scanner and a hand-written recursive descent parser.Until version 3.0, Lua used a parser produced by yacc [13], which proved a valu-able tool when the language's syntax was less stable. However, the hand-writtenparser is smaller, more ecient, more portable, and fully reentrant. It also pro-vides better error messages.

"It is quite easy to write a good scanner by hand and that single change improved Lua performance by something like 30%" - Roberto

"A top down parser also allows for better error messages" -Luiz
